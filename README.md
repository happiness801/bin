# bin
Bin files/scripts

These are the convenience tools I use, typically in WSL/Ubuntu (some are WSL-specific).

## Install

Assumes there isn't already a folder/file at `~/bin`.
Clone at `~`, re-proccess `~/.profile` (because typically, .profile will add `~/bin` to the path, if it exists).

```bash
 cd ~
 clone git@github.com:happiness801/bin.git
 . ~/.profile
```
